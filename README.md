# Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is designed to analyze data from a CSV file and generate a JSON result. It includes a Python script (`execute.py`) that processes the data and outputs the results. The project is set up to run in a CI/CD environment using GitHub Actions.

## Setup and Installation
1. Ensure you have Python 3.11+ and Pandas 2.3 installed.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```

## Usage
- Run the Python script to process the data:
  ```bash
  python execute.py > result.json
  ```

## Code Structure
- `execute.py`: The main script that processes the data.
- `data.csv`: The data file converted from the original Excel format.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: The GitHub Actions workflow file that automates the CI/CD process.

## Functionality
- The script reads data from `data.csv`, processes it, and outputs the results to `result.json`.
- The CI workflow runs `ruff` for linting, executes the script, and publishes the result via GitHub Pages.
